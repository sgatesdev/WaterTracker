## Description

Easily track your daily water intake using Water Tracker!

Water Tracker allows you to track your daily water intake in the most commonly used standard (US) or metric units. Mixing and matching is encouraged. The total accumulates over a 24 hour period and automatically resets at midnight. Clicking or tapping the blue square switches what unit the total displays in (gallons, liters, etc.). No user account necessary - your data stays on your device.

Add it to your phone's home screen for quick access. Note: The iPhone home screen icon will preview the last state of the browser window, so you can actually see in the Water Tracker icon what your current total is.
